[Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636) - pronounced "pixy" ðŸ§š -
is my favorite OAuth standard. It is short, sweet, and solves an important problem in an interesting way.
When I am introducing new developers to OAuth, I recommend they read the PKCE RFC first before diving into others -
like starting with "Of Mice and Men" before opening up "Moby Dick".

## Pee Kay Cee Eee? What?

PKCE  is an extension to the original OAuth standard.

OAuth 2.0 was not originally designed with secure public clients (like mobile or single-page apps) in mind.
In traditional authorization code flows, the client secret is a required part of the token exchangeâ€”but public clients canâ€™t store secrets safely.
This made the flow susceptible to interception attacks, especially in environments where the authorization code could be leaked.

During a public client flow, if an attacker gets access to an authorization code
(for example, see the mess that is [mobile deep linking](https://reactnative.dev/docs/security#authentication-and-deep-linking))
then the attacker can exchange that code themselves. Bad!

PKCE fixes this attack by **cryptographically proving that the caller that starts the OAuth flow is the same caller that completes it**.
This is done by introducing a new `code_verifier` parameter:

1. The client generates a cryptographically random `code_verifier` and stores it locally
1. The client computes the `SHA256` hash of the `code_verifier` to generate a `code_challenge`.
1. The client passes the `code_challenge` to the server as part of the standard OAuth Authorization Request, e.g. `example.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=...&code_challenge=...`.
1. The server records the `code_challenge` and proceeds with the standard OAuth flow, eventually redirecting back to the client with a `?code=...`.
1. The client sends the server the saved `code_verifier` in the request to exchange the `code` for an access token
1. The sever computes the `SHA256` hash of the `code_verifier` itself
    - If the hash matches the saved `code_challenge`, then the server knows that the client is the same one who initiated the flow and no interception occured
    - If the hash does not match, the server fails the request

There are some other bits and pieces around code challenge methods and URL encoding, but that's pretty much the entire spec.

## Top Tier Security API

Unlike many other parts of OAuth, PKCE is designed such that it is impossible to skirt around.
Compare this with something like the `nonce` in OpenID Connect, which clients are expected to validate locally.
If a client forgets or skips validation, the flow still completes. But with PKCE, the server itself enforces the check.
You canâ€™t fake PKCE. You either follow the spec or you fail.

As a bonus, PKCE protects against [Login CSRF](https://support.detectify.com/support/solutions/articles/48001048951-login-csrf) attacks too.
Attackers can't trick an unsuspecting user to click a link and log in to the wrong account because the user won't have the correct `code_verifier`.

## PKCE All The Things

PKCE started out as a specific extension for mobile applications, but is now generally recommended for
[all OAuth applications](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-7.5.2-6).
Talk about a glow up!

PKCE doesn't need to limit itself to OAuth either! Any system that involves HTTP redirects and callbacks can make use of PKCE.
For example, magic links! Magic link flows generally involve a user requesting a login link from a website, and then opening that link from their email.
The link in the email redirects the user back to the website with a token that can be verified.
Want to prevent users from forwarding magic links to friends and family? Or stop E-mail scanners from clicking on links and messing things up?
Add PKCE to the flow and only the device that initiated the magic link flow will be able to authenticate the token.

**Note:** PKCE magic links don't work well when using mobile application WebViews -
when users click the link from their email, the link is opened in a default browser that doesn't have access to the code verifier.
Mobile-focused magic links need to be deeplinks or [universal links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content/) to work well.

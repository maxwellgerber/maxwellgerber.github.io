Most of us think of cookies as a key-value store. Each cookie has a name and a value, and they fit really nicely into
a `Record<string, string>` or `map[string]string` or whatever your preferred notation is.
Unfortunately, this mental model doesn't hold up to reality - **multiple cookies can have the same name**.
This is not a bug—it's how the HTTP specification works, but it can get _pretty weird_.

### Spec Time

The HTTP cookie spec [(RFC 6265)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265) says cookies are uniquely identified by their **name**, **domain**, and **path** combined.
That means you can have multiple cookies with the same name, as long as they have different domains or paths.
The specific verbiage can be found in [Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.3):

> If the cookie store contains a cookie with the same name, domain, and path as the newly created cookie.
> Let old-cookie be the existing cookie with the same name, domain, and path as the newly created cookie
> ... Remove the old-cookie from the cookie store.

I've never really ran into path-scoped cookies professionally, but I assume they're out there somewhere.
Domain-scoped cookies are much more common, and they are a nice feature.

For example, it is _incredibly_ common in SaaS to have your actual product dashboard hosted separately from the company's marketing site.
Product dashboard goes on `app.example.com`, marketing site goes on `example.com`, and this way Marketing can install a
billion tools on the marketing site without Engineering needing to worry too much.

Cookies set with an explicit domain of `example.com` will be available to both `app.example.com` and `example.com`, allowing the separate sites to communicate
some shared state. Cookies set without an explicit domain will only be available on the domain they are set at - so the session token set on `app.example.com`
won't be available for the marketing site to accidentally leak in some way.

Suppose a developer makes a change to their product. Previously a cookie was only available on `example.com`, but now
the developer wants to share that cookie with `app.example.com`.
The developer sets the `domain` attribute on the cookie, deploys their code, and will discover that _both cookies_ will continue to exist.
And the order in which they get serialized to Javascript via `document.cookie` or to a backend service via the `Cookie` header is pretty much a coinflip.

### Demos Demos Demos Demos

Let's create a few cookies using Javascript and see what happens:

**Basic cookie (no attributes):**

<RunnableCodeBlock>{`
document.cookie = "my_cool_cookie=basic";
console.log("document.cookie:", document.cookie);
`}</RunnableCodeBlock>

**Path-specific cookie:**

<RunnableCodeBlock>{`
document.cookie = "my_cool_cookie=path_specific; path=/blog/cookie-shadowing";
console.log("document.cookie:", document.cookie);
`}</RunnableCodeBlock>

**Domain-specific cookie:**

<RunnableCodeBlock>{`
document.cookie = \`my_cool_cookie=domain_specific; domain=\${window.location.hostname}\`;
console.log("document.cookie:", document.cookie);
`}</RunnableCodeBlock>

**Path and Domain-specific cookie:**

<RunnableCodeBlock>{`
document.cookie = \`my_cool_cookie=very_specific; domain=\${window.location.hostname}; path=/blog/cookie-shadowing\`;
console.log("document.cookie:", document.cookie);
`}</RunnableCodeBlock>

Great! You should now have multiple separate entries in `document.cookie` with the same cookie name and distinct cookie values. Pop open Dev Tools too, and you'll be able to see the same thing.

### Cookie Cleanup Time

Cookies are typically deleted by setting an empty string as the value, and by setting the expiry to be sometime in the past.
This means we can't delete these cookies unless we exactly match the name, domain, and path components used when the cookie was initially created.

**Clear basic cookie:**

<RunnableCodeBlock>{`
// Clear only the basic cookie (no attributes)
document.cookie = "my_cool_cookie=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT";
console.log("document.cookie:", document.cookie);
`}</RunnableCodeBlock>

**Clear ALL the cookies:**

<RunnableCodeBlock>{`
document.cookie = \`my_cool_cookie=; expires="Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT"\`;
document.cookie = \`my_cool_cookie=; path=/blog/cookie-shadowing; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\`;
document.cookie = \`my_cool_cookie=; domain=\${window.location.hostname}; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\`;
document.cookie = \`my_cool_cookie=; domain=\${window.location.hostname}; path=/blog/cookie-shadowing; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\`;
console.log("document.cookie:", document.cookie || 'None!');
`}</RunnableCodeBlock>

### The Right Way

Now, this is moderately annoying - but there is some good news. There's a new-ish API called the
[cookieStore](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore) that returns cookie information as a rich object
so all the domain and path metadata is preserved. This can be used to inspect cookies from application code, in case you
are struggling to figure out why some cookie is keeping itself around.

<RunnableCodeBlock>{`
document.cookie = "my_cool_cookie=basic;";
document.cookie = "my_cool_cookie=path_specific; path=/blog/cookie-shadowing;";
let allCookies = await cookieStore.getAll();
console.log('All cookies:', JSON.stringify(allCookies, null, 2));
`}</RunnableCodeBlock>

This feature isn't supported in all browsers yet, but Someday™️!

## The Cookie Crumbles Serverside

We have some problems on the web side, but we also have the tools to deal with those problems.
Things aren't so great on the server, though:

### Browsers will _happily_ send two cookies of the same name in a web request

Tested in Chrome `136.0.7103.114`. Others have tested in [all major browsers](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie/issues/813#issuecomment-1567412628).

  src='/cookie_devtools.png'
  style={{ width: '65vw' }}
  alt='Screenshot of Google Chrome devtools showing two cookies with the same name being sent'
/>

### Nearly every major cookie parsing library fails to deal with multiple cookies of the same name.

Nearly every major library for parsing or interacting with cookies that I have interacted with exposes cookies
to userland as a key-value store.

- [Express.js cookieParser](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser/blob/master/index.js#L103)
- [Django](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/http/cookie.py#L7)
- [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/edge-runtime/blob/main/packages/cookies/src/serialize.ts#L28)
- Lavarel / Symphony / PHP stores cookies as an associative array, though for the life of me I can't find the source code.

The only package I've seen do things _right_ is the [Go stdlib](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.CookiesNamed), which returns an array of cookies matching the given name.
Unless you call the _other_ [cookie method](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.Cookie) defined on the request object, which will only return the first match.

And of course - even if you do inspect the `Cookie` HTTP header yourself and find two cookies with the same name,
what can you realistically do? **There is no equivalent `cookieStore` API for serverside code.**
This means that:

- For `HTTPOnly` cookies there is no mechanism for application code to determine how the cookie was initially set.
- Your backend won't be able to differentiate which of the two cookies is the 'correct' one.

## Takeaways

This isn't really an issue for 99% developers because it is _incredibly rare_ for some other code to
be setting a cookie on your website and for you to not know about it.
The only time cookie shadowing should realistically happen is if you
migrate from sharing a cookie with subdomains to not sharing it, or vice versa. In both of those cases, you should know
exactly how the cookie was set previously anyway.

However, if you write a library or an [SDK](https://stytch.com/docs/sdks) that interacts with cookies on hundreds of websites,
you'll eventually run into someone doing something very weird.

I've spent a decent amount of time over the last few weeks learning basic Mandarin.
I'm still a complete beginner - I think my vocabulary is ~150 words at this point.
Still - I've found the experience to be very fun.
When I was in middle school, I spent several years learning Spanish but never had anything click -
and I could never figure out how to roll my R's .
